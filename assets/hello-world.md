# Professional FAQ

I have recently been receiving a lot of requests from young professionals asking me a list fairly repetitive questions - 
- 

So here we are.

I'm a mechanical engineer. I work at Tesla on thermal management for electric vehicle drive systems. Before that, I spent the better part of a decade in academia studying boiling — specifically, the violent and beautiful physics of what happens when you push a heated surface past its limits.

My PhD thesis was about **Critical Heat Flux**: the moment when boiling goes from efficient cooling to catastrophic failure. It's a problem that's been studied for over a century, and yet there were fundamental questions still unanswered. I had the privilege of working on some of those answers.

But this blog isn't going to be a rehash of my CV. You can find that on the [About](/portfolio.html) page.

What I want to do here is think out loud. About the physics that I find elegant. About the gap between laboratory discoveries and products that work at scale. About what it's like to go from academia to industry. Maybe about the occasional book, or an idea that has nothing to do with heat transfer.

I've found that writing clarifies thinking in ways that internal monologue doesn't. There's something about committing a thought to words — making it legible to someone else — that forces you to be honest about what you actually understand.

So that's the plan. No particular schedule, no promises about frequency. Just a place to put thoughts that feel worth sharing.

Thanks for reading.
