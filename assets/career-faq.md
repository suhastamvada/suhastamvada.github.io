# Career FAQ

I get a lot of DMs and emails from students and early-career engineers asking some version of the same question: *How do I break into the industry? How do I get a job at a company like Tesla?* Instead of repeating myself, here's everything I tell them.

## The One Thing That Matters Most: First Principles Thinking

If I had to pick a single skill that separates great engineers from average ones, it's this. Not CAD proficiency. Not GPA. It's the ability to break down problems from fundamental truths rather than reasoning by analogy.

What does that look like in practice? When you encounter a design problem, you don't just copy what's been done before and tweak it. You ask: what are the physical constraints here? What are the fundamental limits? What does the physics actually demand? You decompose the problem into its most basic elements and build your solution up from there.

This isn't just abstract philosophy. [Farnam Street has a great primer on first principles thinking](https://fs.blog/first-principles/) that's worth reading. And Elon Musk has spoken extensively about this approach -- [this conversation with Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-s_3b5fRd8) is a good example of how he applies it to engineering decisions at scale.

Why does this matter for getting hired? Because interviewers at top companies can tell instantly if you understand fundamentals or are just memorizing formulas. When someone asks you why a design choice was made and your answer starts with "because that's how it's usually done," you've already lost. You can't fake depth. Either you understand the physics or you don't, and that understanding comes from training yourself to think from first principles.

## Hands-On Experience Over Classroom Theory

Classroom knowledge is necessary but not sufficient. What separates engineers who get hired from those who don't is hands-on experience -- the kind you can only get by actually building things.

Build things. Break things. Fix things. Join a Formula SAE team, a robotics club, a research lab. Personal projects count -- maybe even more than coursework, because they show initiative and curiosity. If you've designed and manufactured a part that went on a real vehicle, that tells me more than a 4.0 GPA ever could.

The best engineers I work with have an intuition for how things behave physically -- how a part will deflect under load, where a casting will shrink, why a bearing is running hot. That intuition only comes from touching real hardware.

## Actionable Skills Checklist

If you're a student or early-career ME, here's what I'd focus on:

- **CAD proficiency** -- SolidWorks or NX. Not just modeling -- assemblies, drawings, surfacing. Be fast and fluent. Speed matters when you're iterating on designs daily.

- **GD&T** -- Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing. This is the language of manufacturing. Learn ASME Y14.5 inside and out. If you can't read or create a proper drawing, you'll struggle on day one.

- **Manufacturing methods** -- Understand CNC machining, injection molding, sheet metal, casting, 3D printing. Know what's feasible and what each process constrains. The best designs are the ones that are actually manufacturable.

- **Materials science fundamentals** -- Know your steels, aluminum alloys, polymers. Understand why material selection matters and how processing affects properties.

- **Thermal/fluids fundamentals** -- Even if you're not in thermal, understanding heat transfer and fluid flow helps you think about real-world systems. Everything generates heat. Everything has flow paths.

- **FEA basics** -- Finite element analysis. You don't need to be an expert, but you should be able to set up and interpret a structural or thermal simulation. Know enough to sanity-check results instead of blindly trusting the solver.

- **Communication** -- The ability to explain a complex design decision in plain English (or a clear drawing) is wildly underrated. Technical writing matters. If you can't communicate your ideas clearly, it doesn't matter how good they are.

## Start Building

The path isn't about checking boxes on a list. It's about being genuinely curious about how things work and building the judgment that comes from experience. Stop optimizing your resume and start building things. The rest follows.
