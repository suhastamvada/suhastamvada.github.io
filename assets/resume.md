I'm Suhas — a mechanical engineer fascinated by what happens at the boundaries where phases meet, where heat pushes materials to their limits, and where physics becomes product.

Right now, I'm at **Tesla** in Palo Alto, working on Drive Systems Engineering. I design and validate thermal management systems for the power electronics inside electric vehicle drive inverters — and I'm helping chart the roadmap for what next-generation thermal management looks like. It's the kind of work where the fundamental physics I spent years studying in the lab directly shapes the products that will define the future of transportation.

But let me back up.

## The Early Days

I grew up in Hyderabad, India, and studied mechanical engineering at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University. My senior design project — analyzing guide rods for an automotive head restraint — gave me my first real taste of how engineering impacts human safety. That work ran alongside a design internship at Satyam Venture Engineering Services (BMW Division), where we simulated rear-end collisions on a sedan and managed to improve the safety rating by 8%. It was my first experience seeing how careful analysis translates into something that protects people, and it convinced me I wanted to go deeper.

## Chasing Droplets in Chicago

In 2018, I moved to Chicago to pursue my M.S. at the University of Illinois at Chicago. My research there was beautifully simple in its question and surprisingly complex in its physics: *what happens when an oil drop meets a water surface?*

<p class="img-caption">Oil and water drops: simple in appearance, rich in physics.</p>

We investigated partial coalescence, spreading behavior, and even drop freezing on sublimating surfaces. The scaling laws we developed matched experiments with an R-squared of 0.99 — the kind of agreement that makes you trust the physics. This work had real-world implications too, from oil spill mitigation to self-cleaning surface design.

## The PhD Years: A Century-Old Puzzle

I moved to Gainesville in 2020 to start my Ph.D. at the University of Florida, and this is where things got really exciting.

**Critical Heat Flux** — the point where a boiling surface suddenly and catastrophically fails to remove heat — has been one of the oldest unsolved problems in thermal science. It's the reason nuclear reactors have safety limits. It's the ceiling that constrains how much power you can push through electronics. My thesis, *Physics of Critical Heat Flux — Answers to Century Old Questions and New Discoveries*, tackled this head-on.

<p class="img-caption">The boiling curve — understanding the physics at the critical transition.</p>

We achieved a **6x increase in critical heat flux** and a **5x improvement in heat transfer coefficient** over the state of the art. More importantly, we developed force balance-based correlations that actually *explain* the physics — not just predict it.

One of the most rewarding outcomes was our proof-of-concept **membrane heat sink** that reduced thermal resistance by 10x for data center cooling. We also developed heat pipes for low-gravity environments — because it turns out, keeping things cool in space is just as hard as it sounds.

## From Lab to Product

Between my PhD years, I interned at **Airity Technologies** (now part of Advanced Energy) in Redwood City, where I led a small team of three developing a high-voltage module and bringing it to market. This was my first deep exposure to the full product development cycle — from creating a bill of materials for high-volume manufacturing to contributing to patent applications. Selecting thermal interface materials that had to simultaneously satisfy electrical, thermal, and mechanical requirements taught me something important: real engineering is always multi-objective.

After my PhD, I stayed at UF as a postdoctoral researcher, leading a team of five graduate students and another postdoc. Together, we advanced our phase-change cooling technology from TRL 3 to TRL 6 — bridging the gap from *"this works in a lab"* to *"this could work in a data center."* I also served as the thermal subject-matter expert for advanced technology integration teams, directing thermal modeling for data center pathfinding and product roadmapping.

## What Drives Me

I'm drawn to problems where the physics is rich, the stakes are real, and the engineering has to be elegant. Whether it's understanding why a bubble departs a surface at precisely the moment it does, or designing a cooling system that keeps an EV inverter running at peak efficiency, I find the same satisfaction in the work: making the invisible forces of heat and fluid flow serve human needs.

If any of this resonates — or if you just want to talk about boiling — I'd love to hear from you.

## The Toolbox

Over the years, I've built up a broad set of skills that span the lab, the design office, and the computational world:

**In the lab**: Photolithography, thin-film deposition (sputtering, PECVD, e-beam), etching (wet & DRIE), electroplating, SEM, high-speed imaging, confocal microscopy, tensiometry, interferometry, rapid prototyping, 3D printing, design of experiments, and CNC machining.

**Design & simulation**: SolidWorks, Siemens NX, AutoCAD, Fusion 360, COMSOL, ANSYS (Mechanical, Fluent, Icepack), GD&T, and FMMEA.

**Code**: Python (SciPy, NumPy, OpenCV, TensorFlow, matplotlib, scikit-learn), MATLAB, Fortran, and C.

**Math**: Numerical methods, scaling analysis, linear ODEs, and asymptotic analysis.
