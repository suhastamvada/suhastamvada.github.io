## Experience

**Tesla** — Palo Alto, CA  
**Mechanical Design Engineer** — *Jan 2025 – Present*  
- Own mechanical design and integration for hardware components, balancing **thermal, structural, manufacturability, and reliability** constraints.  
- Drive design from concept → CAD → tolerance/GD&T → release, partnering with cross-functional teams (EE, thermal, manufacturing, test).  
- Support validation via test/bring-up, root-cause analysis, and iterative design improvements.

**University of Florida, Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering** — Gainesville, FL  
**Postdoctoral Associate** — *May 2024 – Jan 2025*  
- Led a team of 5 graduate students and a Post-Doctoral researcher to develop direct-to-chip phase change cooling technology for data centers, successfully bringing technology readiness level (TRL) from 3 to 6.  
- Collaborated with engineering, manufacturing, and reliability teams to develop scalable packaging processes.  
- Performed techno-economic analyses (TEA) to assess commercialization feasibility of heat sinks.

**Graduate Research Assistant** — *Aug 2020 – May 2024*  
- Demonstrated a proof-of-concept (TRL 3) phase change heat sink for data center environments.  
- Achieved a **5× improvement** in heat transfer coefficient (HTC) compared to state-of-the-art technologies.  
- Conceptualized, investigated, and explained physics of critical heat flux (CHF) during pool boiling.  
- Achieved a **6× increase in CHF** through flow stabilization and developed force-balance-based correlations.  
- Developed heat pipes for thermal management in low gravity environments and confined spaces.

**Airity Technologies (Advanced Energy)** — Redwood City, CA  
**Mechanical Engineering Intern** — *May 2023 – Aug 2023*  
- Led a team of 3 interns towards product development of a high voltage module, bringing technology to market.  
- Created bill of materials (BOM) for high-volume manufacturing and contributed towards patent applications.  
- Designed, fabricated, and tested mechanical components for high-voltage power electronic systems.  
- Procured thermal interface materials and heat sinks based on electrical, thermal, and mechanical requirements.

**University of Illinois at Chicago, Mechanical & Industrial Engineering** — Chicago, IL  
**Graduate Research Assistant** — *Jan 2018 – Mar 2020*  
- Investigated oil drop interaction with water-air interfaces in context of oil spills.  
- Designed and conducted experiments, and established scaling laws to predict coalescence and spreading of oils.  
- Investigated freezing and rebound of drops on sublimating surfaces to aid the design of self-cleaning surfaces.  
- Leveraged principles of solid mechanics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics to conduct experiments and formulate models that predict the freezing and rebound characteristics of drops.

**Satyam Venture Engineering Services, BMW Division** — Hyderabad, India  
**Design Intern** — *Nov 2016 – May 2017*  
- Created CAD models of guide rods of an automotive head restraint using design and GD&T specifications.  
- Performed structural analysis simulating a rear end collision on a BMW sedan.  
- Improved passenger safety by 8% by optimizing design to minimize severity of whiplash effect.
