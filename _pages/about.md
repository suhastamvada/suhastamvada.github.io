Welcome to my Homepage! I am a Mechanical Engineer at Tesla. Currently, I am working on improving the performance of traction inverters. Previously, I worked on cooling data center AI chips [(link to manuscript)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12508). Before that, I studied heat and mass transport at interfaces, phase change transport phenomena, and surface engineering. Although my work is primarily experimental, I enjoy exploring computational work in the domain of fluid dynamics and heat transfer. I am beginning to tinker with Machine Learning.
